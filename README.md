## 💻 Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

### 🚀 [Conducting Security Audits](#)  
- **Description**: This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. 

The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

My task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
